INTRODUCTION

Sales performance analysis is a critical process for evaluating the effectiveness of a distributorship’s sales strategies, identifying growth opportunities, and optimizing revenue generation. For Wilmer Chocolate Distributorship, analyzing sales performance helps in understanding market trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency.

PRE ANALYSIS

A pre-analysis phase was conducted to establish an analytical framework before the creation of the dashboard. This pre-analysis phase involves:

Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.

Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing during the analysis.

Potential Insights: I was able to uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.

Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

Microsoft Power BI was the primary analysis and visualization tool used for this project, the Power BI features used include;

DAX Functions

Interactive Visualizations

Power Query

Calculated Columns and Measures

OBSERVATIONS

The peak sales day was observed to be on Monday (as the weekdays was numbered from 1 to 5 with 1 being Monday) as the amount of shipped boxes and revenue were the highest on Monday.

Australia had the highest contribution to the generated revenue and also had the highest amount of shipped boxes as this could be attributed to their culture of eating chocolates as a common snack and not as a luxury good.

Rasberry chocolate generated the most revenue (84K) in the USA while having the a less amount of shipped boxes (1,497) when compared to fruit and nut bars which had the highest amount of shipped boxes (2,061) in the USA and revenue of 48k. this observation could be attributed to the price of the Rasberry chocolate being treated as a luxury good in the USA which is expressed by the pricing.

Manuka honey chocolate and white chocolate generated 68K and 67K respectively while having 1,150 and 1,204 boxes shipped respectively and when compared with the revenue generated with the other top shipped products in the USA, the two products are generating more revenue because of their pricing as they are seen as a luxury product.

Peanut butter cubes which is the second highest revenue generating product in Canada at 62K has a low amount of shipped boxes when compared to the top ten products by shipped boxes in Canada therefore this high revenue could be attributed to the pricing of the product as it is seen as a luxury chocolate brand in Canada.

White chocolate generated 46k while having a very low amount of shipped boxes at 701 when compared to the other products in Canada.
